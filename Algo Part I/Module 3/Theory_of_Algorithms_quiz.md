### ❓ Quiz Question

**Which of the following functions is O(n³)?**

- [ ] 11n + 15lg n + 100  
- [ ] 1/3 n²  
- [ ] 25,000n³  
- [x] All of the above ✅  

### ✅ Correct Answer: All of the above

Recall that **big-Oh notation** provides only an upper bound on the growth rate of a function as _n_ gets large. In this course, we primarily use **tilde notation** because it more accurately describes the function—it provides both an upper and lower bound on the function, as well as the coefficient of the leading term.
