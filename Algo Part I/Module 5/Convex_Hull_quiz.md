### Convex Hull Vertices

What is the maximum number of vertices that can be on the convex hull of a set of n points?

- [ ] constant  
- [ ] logarithmic  
- [x] linear  
- [ ] linearithmic

**Correct**  
If the input points are points on the circumference of a circle (or vertices of a regular n-gon), then all n points will be on the convex hull.
