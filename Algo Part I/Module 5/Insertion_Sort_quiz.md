### Insertion Sort on Sorted Input

How many compares does insertion sort make on an input array that is already sorted?

- [ ] constant  
- [ ] logarithmic  
- [x] linear  
- [ ] quadratic

**Correct**  
Each item (except the first) is compared against the item to its left (and to no other items), for a total of nâˆ’1 compares.
