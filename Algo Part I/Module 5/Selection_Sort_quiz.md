### Selection Sort on Sorted Input

How many compares does selection sort make when the input array is already sorted?

- [ ] logarithmic  
- [ ] linear  
- [x] quadratic  
- [ ] exponential

**Correct**  
The number of compares and exchanges made by selection sort does **not** depend on the order of the input.
