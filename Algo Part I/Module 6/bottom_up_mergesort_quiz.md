### Question

**How many passes (over the input array) does bottom-up mergesort make in the worst case?**

- [ ] constant  
- [x] logarithmic  
- [ ] linear  
- [ ] linearithmic  

**Explanation:**  
Bottom-up mergesort makes ∼log₂n passes over the input array in the worst case, doubling the size of sorted subarrays in each pass.
